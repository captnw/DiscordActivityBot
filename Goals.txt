// Goals for this test branch //

TODO:
-1) Change from .csv file storage to .db file storage (using sqlite3)
-2) Make the bot timezone agnostic (store things by UTC ... then give users Pacific time by default (they ccan request other timezones))
-3) Make bot DM pictures to users by default (they can specify an argument that they want the image to be posted in the server)
-4) Don't store names and hash the user's ID somehow to give the data a basic encrytption (for privacy)
-5) Rewrite documentation (for bot hints AND on github repo (on setting up this bot))
-6?) Host bot using Heroku (free for small projects ... very similar to AWS that you have to login via console)
